    "\n",
    "The full Stokes calibration procedure is done across as much of the SPW as is requested in the config file. In the default case, the entire SPW (spanning ~ 800 MHz) is calibrated across. The caveat here is that CASA does not support a true wideband, full polarization calibration. For example the Stokes Q and U values of a source with non-zero RM across the band will not be correctly accounted for. The assumption CASA makes is that the bandwidth is split into several smaller SPWs (such as is the case of VLA or ALMA) and that the Stokes parameters within each SPW can be assumed to be a constant. We have identified work-arounds to this, and will be implementing the fix in upcoming versions of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-hand calibration performs the following steps:\n",
    "* Delay calibration (the K term), time averaged, parallel hand\n",
    "* Bandpass calibration (the B term), time averaged, parallel hand\n",
    "* Cross hand delay calibration (the KCROSS term), time averaged, cross hand\n",
    "\n",
    "After the cross-hand delay calibration is performed, we iterate over calculating the time dependent gains. Initially the time-dependent gains are calculated for the primary and secondary calibrators, as a function of time and parallactic angle. The polarization properties of the secondary are assumed to be unknown, and are determined from the gain variation as a function of parallactic angle. This is fit for by the `qufromgain` task, which is contained in `almapolhelpers` and can be accessed in CASA by\n",

    "This imports several helper tasks that are meant to solve ALMA polarization, but are general enough to work with any telescope that has linear feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the fractional Q and U values are determined for the phase calibrator, the gain solutions are recomputed with the fractional polarization as an input, in theory resulting in more accurate gain solutions. This is followed by a call to `xyamb`, also within `almapolhelpers` that breaks the ambiguity in the X-Y phases for the solutions generated by `qufromgain`. These can be cross-checked with the solutions obtained by running `gaincal` with `gaintype='XYf+QU'` which solves for the X-Y phase as a function of frequency, assuming an unknown source Q, U value. Finally we run `polcal` in the `Dflls` mode in order to calculate the polarization leakage (the D term) as a function of frequency (f), using a linear least squares algorithm (lls). Finally, we bootstrap the fluxes from the primary to the secondary using `fluxscale`."
